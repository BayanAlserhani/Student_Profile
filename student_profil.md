Student Career Goal Statement 


My career goal is a two sided goal, I'm looking for the  one that would give me the opportunity to be proficient and passionate at the same time. I'm absulutlly not considering an easy conventional career that would put a limit to my improvement. 

I'm a person who likes challenges, especially if it come with math background, so I would like to work with companies that provide advanced financial services as predicting risks using artificial intelligence or providing a whole new system of financial services.
